# TangoSIDM_DMFraction


The TangoSIDM_DMFraction project in this repository is part of the project led by C. Correa (see tangosidm.com). The goal is to extract the dark matter fraction information within massive galaxies from simulation data and observations and compare them. The reader will find information about the datasets included in the 'data' folder: it consists of 3 CSV files as we use 3 different samples to construct it.
