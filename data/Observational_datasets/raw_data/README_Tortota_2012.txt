"We analyze the central dark-matter (DM) content of ∼ 4, 500 massive (M⋆ >∼
1010 M⊙),
low-redshift (z < 0.1), early-type galaxies (ETGs)"

" We estimate the “central” fraction of DM within the K-band effective radius, Reff, using spherically symmetric isotropic galaxy model"

"Constant M/L. Some studies of ordinary ETGs suggest
that the mass profile falls off roughly as steeply as the stars,
at small to intermediate radii, which may imply either little
DM in their centres or DM profiles that mimic the stars
(Romanowsky et al. 2003; Douglas et al. 2007; Deason et al.
2012). The mass profile is given by M(r) = Υ0 L(r), where
Υ0 is the typical mass-to-light ratio of the system and L(r)
is the luminosity profile, modeled here by the S´ersic (1968)
law. Hence, the mass distribution is assumed to follow the
profile of the stellar component, whose shape (i.e. the S´ersic
n), changes from galaxy to galaxy, reflecting the structural
non-homology of the light profiles of ETGs.
"

"Stellar masses are derived by fitting synthetic stellar population (SP) models from Bruzual & Charlot (2003, BC03
hereafter) to the optical+NIR photometry, using the software LePhare (Ilbert et al. 2006). The observed galaxy
fluxes determine the normalization of the best-fit template,
which then gives the stellar mass, M⋆ (initially computed
within the SDSS Kron aperture, which we correct using
S´ersic models to total mass). We adopt a set of SP models
with different star-formation e-folding times (τ 6 15 Gyr),
internal reddenings (E(B − V ) 6 0.5), and metallicities
(0.2 6 Z/Z⊙ 6 3), assuming a Cardelli et al. (1989) extinction law and Chabrier IMF."
