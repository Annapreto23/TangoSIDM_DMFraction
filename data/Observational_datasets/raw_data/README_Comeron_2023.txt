"In this paper, we examine the stellar kinematics of NGC 1277
and NGC 1278 and produce detailed dynamical Jeans models
with JAM1"

"The goal of this article is to describe the dark matter distribution of NGC 1277 out to an unprecedented radius of five effective
radii (5 Re, corresponding to 6 kpc). Because of the relic nature
of the target, this is equivalent to studying the dark matter halo
properties of a massive ETG at z & 2."
