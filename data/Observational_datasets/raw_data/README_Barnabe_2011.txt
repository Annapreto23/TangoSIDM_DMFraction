"While calculating a lower limit for the dark matter content is useful, galaxies need not have maximal bulges. We therefore set the
scale for the luminous mass profiles by adopting, for each system,
the stellar mass inferred from stellar population synthesis models,
assuming either a Chabrier (2003) or a Salpeter (1955) IMF. We
use stellar mass values taken from the stellar population analysis performed by Auger et al. (2009) on a data set constituted by
deep, high-resolution, multi-band HST observations of the SLACS
lenses."
