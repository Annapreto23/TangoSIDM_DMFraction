"We combine in a self-consistent way the constraints from both gravitational lensing and stellar kinematics to perform a detailed investigation of the internal mass distribution, amount of
dark matter, and dynamical structure of the sixteen early-type lens galaxies from the SLACS
Survey, at z = 0.08 − 0.33, for which both HST/ACS and NICMOS high-resolution imaging
and VLT VIMOS integral-field spectroscopy are available. Based on this data set, we analyze
the inner regions of the galaxies, i.e. typically within one (three-dimensional) effective radius
re, under the assumption of axial symmetry and by constructing dynamical models supported
by two-integral stellar distribution functions (DFs)." 

"While calculating a lower limit for the dark matter content is useful, galaxies need not have maximal bulges. We therefore set the
scale for the luminous mass profiles by adopting, for each system,
the stellar mass inferred from stellar population synthesis models,
assuming either a Chabrier (2003) or a Salpeter (1955) IMF. We
use stellar mass values taken from the stellar population analysis performed by Auger et al. (2009) on a data set constituted by
deep, high-resolution, multi-band HST observations of the SLACS
lenses."
