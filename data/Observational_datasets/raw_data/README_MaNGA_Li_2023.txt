Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) of the integral-field stellar kinematics for near 6000 galaxies from the MaNGA DynPop project,
with stellar masses 109 M  M‚àó  1012 M, including both early-type and late-type galaxies."

"We select galaxies with an acceptable visual modelling
quality (i.e. Qual ‚©æ 1) to ensure that the density slopes are reliable.
For these approximately 6000 galaxies, we require the difference in
the mass-weighted total density slope between JAMcyl and JAMsph
modelling (see Section 3.1) is smaller than three times of 0.079,
which is the observed root-mean-square (rms) scatter of this dynamical property among different model assumptions for galaxies with
Qual = 1 (see Fig. 13 and Table 3 of Paper I), to ensure the reliability of our conclusion. In result, our final MaNGA sample includes
5688 galaxies. For more information of modelling qualities and the
dynamical modeling, readers are referred to Paper I.

"We add the filtering condition  | ùëìDM,cyl ‚àí ùëìDM,sph| < 0.1, to improve the accuracy of measuring the dark matter fraction."
